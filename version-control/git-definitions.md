# Git Definitions
##Made some changes to my project. Hope you like them! :)
**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control allows us to view entire history of revisions to one or more files and merge revisions made by one or more people. It is useful because it allows multiple people work on a project at the same time while making changes that will not affect the original (master) project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* When working on a project, a branch allows you to create a copy of the project which individual team members can make changes to without disrupting the master project. These branches are the copies that different people can work on without changing the master project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is a save point for a project for future reference. A good commit message must:
1. Be detailed
2. State changes since the last commit
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is arises when two or more people are making changes to a working branch and because Git cannot determine which/whose instruction to follow, it issues a CONFLICT error message until the issue is resolved.
