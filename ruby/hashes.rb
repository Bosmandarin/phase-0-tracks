##Do the thing
#Pseudocode: Save the user inputs in some variables which will be the values
#in the hash. Create the hash and assign keys to each value using the symbol
#notation. Print our the hash. If the designer would like to update some
#information, present the options again to the designer, have the designer pick
#from the options. Use a loop for every option to make sure the right updated value
#goes to the right key in the hash. Present the new hash
